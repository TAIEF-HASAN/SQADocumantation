This is not the complete list as there are more than <a href="Testing-Type.md"> 150 types of testing </a> types and still adding. Also, noteable is that not all testing types are applicable to all projects but depend on the nature & scope of the project.

<h3> Testing Straegies in software Engineering </h3>

Here are important strateegies in software engineering:

**Unit Testing:** This software testing basic approch is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developer to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.

**Integration testing:** If focuses on the construction and design of the software. it's need to see that the integrated units are working correctly or not.
