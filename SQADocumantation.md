<h3>Types Of Software Testing</h3>

Here are the software Testing Type:

Typically Testing is clasified into three categories.

- **Functional Testing**
- **Non-Functional Testing or Performance Testing**
- **Maintenance (Regration and Maintence)**

Sub Type of <strong>Functional</strong> testing:

- **Unit Testing**
- **Integration Testing**
- **Smoke**
- **UAT (Acceptance Testing)**
- **Localization**
- **Globalization**
- **Interoperability**
- **So on**

Sub Type of <strong>Non-Functional</strong> testing:

- **Performance**
- **Enduance**
- **Load**
- **Volume**
- **Scalability**
- **Usability**
- **So on**

Sub Type of <strong>Maintenance</strong> testing:

- **Regression**
- **Maintenance**

This is not the complete list as there are more than <a href="Testing-Type.md"> 150 types of testing </a> types and still adding. Also, noteable is that not all testing types are applicable to all projects but depend on the nature & scope of the project.

<h3> Testing Straegies in software Engineering </h3>

Here are important strateegies in software engineering:

**Unit Testing:** This software testing basic approch is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developer to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.

**Integration testing:** If focuses on the construction and design of the software. it's need to see that the integrated units are working correctly or not.

**System testing:** In this method, the software is complied as a whole and tested as a whole. This testing strategy checks the functionality, security, portability, amongest others.

<h3>Program Testing</h3>

**Program Testing** in software testing is a method of executing an actual software program with the aim of testing program behavior and finding errors. The software program is executated with test case data to analyse the program behavior or response to the test data. A good program testing is one which has high chances of finding bugs.
